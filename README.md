# Scripts to automate simple tasks in Milestone XProtect and AXIS

1. [Milestone AXIS check SD card](https://github.com/ChrissFurenes/Milestone-PS-tool/tree/main/1.%20Milestone_AXIS_check_SD_Card)
   - This script checks the SD card status of AXIS cameras in a Milestone XProtect environment.
   - It requires the `milestoneps-tools` module and an admin user in XProtect.

2. [Milestone Camera model group](https://github.com/ChrissFurenes/Milestone-PS-tool/tree/main/2.%20Milestone_Camera_model_group)
   - When running it wil ask to connect to an management server, then creating groups based on camera model name
   - it only adds camera stream that is enabled

## TODO
- make script to make camera foler based on camera model and assign camera to it.
- report of system and cameras
